## 02441 Applied Statistics and Statistical Software 
# Exercise 3B - Fertilizer


```{r "setup", include=FALSE}
## set working directory
require("knitr")
```

In a pilot study two different fertilizers were tested on three different fields. The yeild (compared to
a reference) is given in the table below 

Fertilizer/Field | a  | b |  c |   
---- | ---- |  ---- | ---- |   
a | 10.3 |-4.95 | -6
b | 10.3 | -4.95 | -11

## 1. Type the data into R so that appropriate analysis can be carried out

```{r}
# Code here
```

## 2. Determine whether Fertilizer and/or Field influence on the yield
Start by making a one-way anova

```{r}
# Code here
```

## 3. Is it possible to test for interaction effects between Fertilizer and Field?

```{r}
# Code here
